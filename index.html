         <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
               I'm a recent UC Berkeley grad, with a B.A. in Data Science and an emphasis in economics. My academic background focuses on statistical inference with applications in econometrics, probability theory, and Jupyter notebook-style data analysis. My favorite classes were programming data structures and probability for data science, and my toughest class was stochastic processes. 
            </p>
            <p>
               I'm proficient in Python with a wide array of data science packages (numpy, pandas, scikit, scipy stats etc.) and have experience with Java. I also have knowledge in SQL, markup languages such as HTML and LaTeX, and Microsoft Excel.
            </p>
            <p>
               My hobbies include digital art and singing pop punk tunes. I'm passionate about data ethics, data for social and environmental good, and data privacy. I hope to find a career doing work that places data ethics, human impact, and privacy at the forefront!
